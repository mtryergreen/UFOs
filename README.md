# UFOs

## Objective
The objective of this project was to gain experience in creating an online database which can be filtered via a set of list elements (Date, City, Location, Shape, etc.). 
The database consisted of accounts of UFO sightings, and I created a site where anyone could sort through the sightings via a set of filters. An HTML page was used to put all the information into an easily readable format, a CSS page was used for formatting and style, and JavaScript was used for the overall functionality of the site. I was able to connect the HTML site to the CSS and the JavaScript pages through the "link" and "script" commands, effectively pointing the HTML towards what format and data to pull structure from.

## Drawbacks
The formatting for the webpage is still clunky, and is not very aesthetic. The filter bar doesn't orient along with the perspective of the viewer, and is static on the page. The site also does not seem to adapt to the device of the viewer. 

## Recomendations 
We could change the filtering options so that specific tag words would retrieve results, such as "hovering" and "circling". Another option for improvement would be a box where UFOlogists could type and submit their newer sightings based on the already filtered criteria, so that the results would add, pending approval of admin. 

## Conclusion
This HTML/CSS/JS project helped us create a site that enabled users to search for UFO sightings based on a number of criteria. Ultimately, I was able to create a search result area that changed as the filter criteria was manipulated.
